                    <h1>'DAMN.' by Kendrick Lamar</h1>
                    <h2> $32.99</h2>
                    <p> Kendrick Lamar has proven he's a master storyteller, but he's been saving his best plot twist this whole time, waiting until he was ready, or able, to pull it off. Rated a 9.3 on pitchfork.com— DAMN. is a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick's destiny in America.</p>

                    <h1>'The Score' by The Fugees</h1>
                    <h2>$34.99</h2>
                    <p>The Score was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful album. It showcased the groups acrobatic lyrical techniques  turning the trio into global superstars. Given a 9.3 by pitchfork.com—a prolific music publication, The Score is considered one of the most “timeless classics” of its time.</p>

                    <h1>'CTRL.' by SZA</h1>
                    <h2>$34.99</h2>
                    <p>In her debut album,  Sza skips the friendly hello and dives straight into SZA's world. It seemed intimate and diaristic, but it was never one-note: SZA was at turns happy, sad, liberated, hurt, confused, tormented, jealous, anxious. From start to finish, it's nothing less than outstanding - the late arrival of a very important artist. Rated an 8.4 on pitchfork.com— SZA’s deeply personal lens on modern romance gives these songs endless life.</p>

                        <h2>$31.99</h2>
                        <p>The effortlessly soothing Ari Lennox and her debut full-length Shea Butter Baby live up to the rich evocations of the title. The album's fluidity can be credited to flawless sequencing; it's perfect as there isn't a single shift out of place. Rated a 7.3 on pitchfork.com—  Shea Butter Baby is a balm, elevating Lennox to the upper echelon of today’s neo-R&B and soul wave.</p>

                        <h1>'21' by Adele</h1>
                        <h2>$26.99</h2>
                        <p>	The songs hold to simple instrumentation and simple structures that allow Adele’s raspy, expressive voice to develop the story in the verses before she delivers the hook. Recognized as one of the “greatest break-up albums of all time”, Adele and her team have crafted an album that’s both full of songs that have the potential to reach the upper reaches of the charts. Rated an 8.2 on pitchfork.com— Its songs - all potential hits - are intelligent and capable of drawing in adoration from every age-group imaginable.</p>

                            <h2>$39.99</h2>
                            <p>Homecoming: The Live Album is the type of victory lap worthy of a queen. What makes Homecoming — both the album and the live performance — so classic is that Beyonce makes clear, now and forever, that she is unapologetically, and beautifully, Black. Rated a 9.3 on pitchfork.com— Beyoncé’s historic Coachella set is preserved as a stunning live album that captures an artist at her peak, flexing her catalog and shining a light on the genius of black artists that came before her.</p>

                            <h2>$36.99</h2>
                            <p>In the Cole’s major-label debut album, he shows listeners that he is brainier than most mainstream MCs but too flashy for the underground.The North Carolina-bred rapper/producer has clearly grown a lot since 2007, when he first started turning heads. Rated a 6.1 on pitchfork.com— there are mixed feelings and reviews about Cole World.</p>

                                <h2>$31.99</h2>
                                <p>An album with nothing but time on its hands and an understanding that healing is a slow, tedious process, Swimming is most engaging when it details the simple things Miller tells himself to keep his spirits up. Modest as it is, his voice is expressive in ways his plainspoken prose could never be, capturing his resignation without turning sadness into a performative spectacle. Rated a 7.5 on pitchfork.com— Swimming is the last album Miller put out before his untimely death.</p>

                                <h2>$45.99</h2>
                                <p>Thriller is the biggest-selling album of all time; it says so on the cover of this reissue package. What it doesn’t say is that, on a worldwide scale, it outpaces the Eagles, Pink Floyd, and Celine Dion by more than just a marginal million or so: At 100 million+ copies sold, it’s estimated to have sold more than twice its nearest rival. Rated a 7.2 on pitchfork.com— The biggest-selling album of all time returns on a gold-plated 25th edition that reminds us of its frequent brilliance and adds both a DVD and bonus tracks featuring Kanye West, Akon, will.i.am, and Fergie.</p>

                                    <h2>$35.99</h2>
                                    <p>Wayne’s greatest strength continues to be his linguistic agility. Lil Wayne's 'Tha Carter III' is a classic album for the moment it was and the moment it became. Rated an 8.7 on pitchfork.com— Tha Carter III, the epic culmination of a lifetime of eccentricities as this is Wayne's moment and he embraces it on his own terms.</p>
